## Objective

This workshop implements a simple but realistic **Inverted Index** with positional information.  
We apply standard Information Retrieval (IR) techniques on real text to show how search systems store and match words and phrases efficiently.

## Contents

- **IR_InvertedMatrix_Workshop.ipynb** — Jupyter notebook with:
  - Document collection
  - Tokenizer
  - Normalization pipeline
  - Positional inverted index
  - Queries and results
- **README.md** — This file with all project details.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kittuai/IR-invertedmatrix-workshop.git
   cd IR-invertedmatrix-workshop
   ```

2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab or VS Code.

3. Run each step: Document loading → Tokenizer → Normalization → Index → Queries.

## Key Learning

- How to tokenize and normalize text.
- How an inverted index maps terms to documents.
- How positional indexing supports phrase queries.
- How to test queries with clear results.

---

## Final Note

This notebook shows the core IR pipeline behind modern search.  
It is a practical base for more advanced indexing and ranking methods.
